- Billing and insurance information access
- Care plan tracking and educational resources

**Admin Portal Features:**
- Patient management and records
- Appointment scheduling and calendar management
- Billing and insurance processing
- Prescription management
- Document management
- Analytics and reporting

## Integration Planning

To ensure seamless integration with your existing clinic operations, we need to understand your current software infrastructure. This will help us design the most efficient data synchronization and API connections.

## Information Request

Could you please provide details about your current systems for:

1. **Patient Management System**
   - What software do you use for patient records?
   - Does it have API capabilities or export functions?

2. **Appointment Scheduling**

   - Do you have e-prescribing capabilities?

5. **Document Management**

## Next Steps

Once we understand your current systems, we can:

- Plan the migration strategy
- Ensure HIPAA compliance throughout the integration

## Timeline

We're in the early planning phase and would like to complete this research within the next 2-3 weeks to begin development of the integration components.
